# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Local development server (Python)
npm run start

# Alternative dev server with no cache (Node.js)
npm run serve

# Validate JavaScript syntax
npm run validate

# Basic PWA functionality test
npm run test
```

## Architecture Overview

Secretary AI is an **offline-first PWA** with a modular, service-oriented architecture:

### Core Module Interaction
- **SecretaryApp** (`js/app.js`) - Main controller coordinating all services
- **TaskParser** (`js/task-parser.js`) - Converts `tasks.md` to structured task objects
- **LLMService** (`js/llm-service.js`) - OpenRouter API integration with fallback scheduling
- **StorageService** (`js/storage.js`) - Coordinates local IndexedDB and cloud sync
- **FirestoreService** (`js/firestore.js`) - Cloud sync with offline-first strategy

### Data Flow Pipeline
1. TaskParser loads/parses `tasks.md` ‚Üí structured tasks
2. LLMService processes tasks ‚Üí AI-generated daily schedule via OpenRouter
3. StorageService saves locally + syncs to Firestore
4. UI renders with real-time filtering (shows only upcoming tasks)

## Configuration System

**Environment Detection**: The app auto-detects localhost vs GitHub Pages and adjusts paths accordingly.

**Key Configuration (`js/config.js`)**:
- `FIREBASE_CONFIG` - Firestore credentials for cross-device sync
- `APP_CONFIG.openRouter` - Model selection and fallback chains
- Environment flags control mock data, debug logging, and feature enablement

**Dynamic Path Resolution**: Use `Config.getResourceUrl(path)` for GitHub Pages compatibility instead of relative paths.

## OpenRouter Integration

**Model Strategy**: Primary model with fallback array for reliability:
```javascript
// Default: Claude 3.5 Sonnet ‚Üí GPT-4o Mini ‚Üí Free models
```

**Key Features**:
- Structured JSON output via OpenRouter's JSON schema enforcement
- Cost estimation and usage tracking
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Authentication testing via `/auth/key` endpoint

**Schedule Generation**: Creates time-aware prompts with current context, handles task prioritization, and implements fallback scheduling when LLM fails.

## Firestore Sync Architecture

**Single-User Design**: Uses fixed user ID (`default-user`) - no authentication required.

**Data Structure**:
```
users/default-user/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schedules/{date}           # Daily schedule data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_states/current        # Task completion status  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/user_preferences  # App configuration
```

**Sync Strategy**: Immediate local save + background cloud sync with "cloud wins" conflict resolution.

## Service Worker Caching

**Multi-layered Strategy**:
- Cache-first for static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Network-first for API calls with offline fallbacks
- Background sync triggers data sync when connection restored

**Important**: Service worker uses relative paths (`./sw.js`) for GitHub Pages compatibility.

## Development Patterns

**No Build Process**: Direct static file serving - just start a local server and develop.

**Environment Handling**: 
- Development mode (localhost) shows debug logs and can use mock data
- Production mode auto-detects GitHub Pages paths
- Feature flags in config control Firestore, logging, etc.

**Testing**: Use `test-api.html` for debugging OpenRouter API integration and environment detection.

## Common Development Tasks

**Adding New Task Categories**: Modify TaskParser's section detection patterns and add corresponding CSS classes.

**Updating AI Models**: Edit `APP_CONFIG.openRouter.models` array in config.js - first model is primary, others are fallbacks.

**Modifying Sync Logic**: StorageService coordinates local/cloud - modify here for different sync strategies.

**UI Updates**: Main UI rendering in SecretaryApp's `updateScheduleDisplay()` and `renderTaskItem()` methods.

## Deployment Notes

**GitHub Pages**: App auto-detects subdirectory deployment and adjusts all paths accordingly. No configuration needed.

**Firebase Setup**: Update `FIREBASE_CONFIG` in config.js with your project credentials. Single-user setup uses open security rules.

**API Key Management**: OpenRouter keys stored in browser localStorage - never commit to repository.

## File Dependencies

**Critical Path**: `tasks.md` must exist in root directory for task parsing to work.

**Module Loading Order**: config.js ‚Üí validation-utils.js ‚Üí event-manager.js ‚Üí ui-components.js ‚Üí storage.js ‚Üí firestore.js ‚Üí task-data-service.js ‚Üí schedule-data-service.js ‚Üí task-parser.js ‚Üí llm-service.js ‚Üí app.js (as defined in index.html).

**Service Worker**: Caches all JS modules and tasks.md for offline functionality.

### Data Architecture Changes

#### New Firestore Structure
```
users/default-user/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {task-id}              # Individual task documents
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ categories/            # Category configurations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schedules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {YYYY-MM-DD}          # Daily generated schedules
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ history/              # Completion tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_preferences      # Current settings
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ai_learning           # AI behavior customization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ analytics/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ productivity_metrics  # Performance tracking
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pattern_analysis      # Behavioral insights
```

#### Task Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "task-12345",
  text: "Pick up package from Correos",
  section: "upcomingTasks",
  priority: "high",
  date: "2024-06-16",
  completed: false,
  subTasks: ["Take passport"],
  reminders: [{type: "location", text: "Near post office"}],
  createdAt: "2024-06-15T10:30:00Z",
  modifiedAt: "2024-06-15T10:30:00Z",
  completedAt: null,
  estimatedDuration: 30,
  actualDuration: null
}
```

### Backward Compatibility Strategy

1. **TaskParser Evolution**: 
   - Primary mode: Work with structured JSON from Firestore
   - Legacy mode: Continue parsing tasks.md for import
   - Export mode: Generate tasks.md from structured data

2. **Gradual Migration**:
   - Phase 1: Dual system (read tasks.md, save to Firestore)
   - Phase 2: Firestore primary (tasks.md as backup)
   - Phase 3: Full web-based management (tasks.md export only)

3. **LLMService Compatibility**:
   - No changes needed - same JSON structure expected
   - Potentially faster since no markdown parsing required
   - Enhanced context from historical data

### Success Metrics

#### User Experience
- **Task Management**: Time to add/edit tasks < 30 seconds
- **Schedule Access**: View any date's schedule < 3 seconds
- **Cross-Device**: Changes sync < 5 seconds
- **Offline Support**: Full functionality without internet

#### AI Secretary Performance  
- **Schedule Quality**: User satisfaction with AI suggestions
- **Predictive Accuracy**: AI learns user patterns effectively
- **Proactive Value**: AI identifies optimization opportunities
- **Planning Efficiency**: Reduces daily planning time by 50%

### Implementation Priority

**Must Have (MVP)**: Web task editing, basic CRUD, sync with existing AI
**Should Have**: Multi-date view, historical schedules, improved AI context
**Could Have**: Advanced analytics, conversational interface, habit tracking
**Won't Have (V1)**: Team sharing, complex project management, external integrations

This roadmap transforms Secretary AI from "AI schedule viewer" to "AI personal secretary" - a comprehensive system for task management and intelligent daily planning that grows with the user's needs.
