# Task Duplication Fix

## Problem Resolved

If you were experiencing duplicate tasks appearing in the Task Management view, this has now been fixed!

### What Was Happening

Every time the app started:
1. The task parser would read `tasks.md` and generate new IDs for each task
2. The migration process would think these were "new" tasks (different IDs)
3. The same tasks would be added to Firestore again with different IDs

### How It's Fixed

1. **Stable IDs**: Tasks now get consistent IDs based on their content
   - The same task always gets the same ID
   - No more new IDs on every parse

2. **Smart Duplicate Detection**: Migration now checks for duplicates by:
   - Task ID (as before)
   - Task content (new check)

3. **Automatic Cleanup**: The app will automatically:
   - Remove any existing duplicates on startup
   - Keep the oldest version of each task
   - Run deduplication max once per day

### What You Need to Do

**Nothing!** Just refresh the app and:
- Existing duplicates will be cleaned up automatically
- No more duplicates will be created
- Your task management will work as expected

### If You Still See Issues

1. Clear your browser's localStorage
2. Refresh the page
3. Let the app run its cleanup process

The fix is now live and will prevent future duplications!
