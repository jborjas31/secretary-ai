OpenRouter helps developers source and optimize AI usage. We believe the future is multi-model and multi-provider.

## Why OpenRouter?

**Price and Performance**. OpenRouter scouts for the best prices, the lowest latencies, and the highest throughput across dozens of providers, and lets you choose how to [prioritize](/docs/features/provider-routing) them.

**Standardized API**. No need to change code when switching between models or providers. You can even let your users [choose and pay for their own](/docs/use-cases/oauth-pkce).

**Real-World Insights**. Be the first to take advantage of new models. See real-world data of [how often models are used](https://openrouter.ai/rankings) for different purposes. Keep up to date in our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1091220969173028894/1094454198688546826).

**Consolidated Billing**. Simple and transparent billing, regardless of how many providers you use.

**Higher Availability**. Fallback providers, and automatic, smart routing means your requests still work even when providers go down.

**Higher Rate Limits**. OpenRouter works directly with providers to provide better rate limits and more throughput.
